# Professional Conduct

Establishing a dependable and a reliable product requires a high level of discipline.

## Guidelines for ThreeFold Team Members

- **Complete Team Profiles:** Ensure your user profile in [teams directory](/wiki/team/) in the format of `$fist_last.md` is as comprehensive as Kristof's.
  - Each user should have a personalized page, such as despiegk, containing relevant details, coordinates, SSH keys, etc.
  - Ensure inclusion in the team.md overview.

- **Link to Projects and Assignments:**
  - On each person's page, provide links to the projects you are actively involved in.
  - Link your assignments in the respective GitHub projects (refer to [Kristof's example](/wiki/team/despiegk.md)).
    - Example: [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/freeflowuniverse/projects/3/views/8?filterQuery=-status%3A%22%E2%9C%85+Done%22+assignee%3Adespiegk)
    - This allows transparency regarding your ongoing work across multiple projects.

- **Project Management:**
  - For projects on GitHub, maintain up-to-date information:
    - List all remaining work with deadlines and remaining hours, especially in active columns like 'in_progress.'
    - Ensure all known issues/tasks in active projects are documented.

- **Ownership of Stories & Tasks:**
  - Take responsibility for your assigned stories and tasks.
  - If unable to complete a task, collaborate with product owners/stakeholders, either pushing it to the next release or placing it in the 'blocked' column.
  - Properly define and link all owned stories with the appropriate label (e.g., type_story) and link them to the correct project.
  - Follow up on owned stories, ensuring linked issues are properly managed within the relevant project.

- **Adherence to Deadlines:**
  - Respect deadlines; if unable to meet them, escalate the matter promptly.

- **Product Ownership:**
  - If you own a product, clearly define your ownership in the [components list](https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/blob/master/wiki/components/components_overview.md).

- **Collaboration Etiquette:**
  - Approach collaboration with diligence:
    - Think before acting, read before executing, and seek clarification when necessary.
    - Attend company and work-related meetings unless a valid reason is communicated.
    - Work harmoniously with the community, acknowledging and appreciating their contributions.
    - Prioritize completion and excellence before moving on to the next task, utilizing GitHub issue comments and effective communication.
    - Refrain from performing tasks merely out of obligation; instead, take the time to execute them thoroughly, recognizing that incomplete work impacts those around you.

## Reporting updates

We recommend this format, it helps with asynchronous communication.
