# Issue Labels Usage Guidelines

Kindly refrain from using labels other than the specified ones.

## Priority-based Labels

- `priority_critical`: This label indicates that the issue requires immediate attention, with a maximum resolution timeframe of the same day.
    - If the assigned developer deems this timeline unachievable, they must escalate the issue immediately.
    - The term "critical" implies that the resolution is of utmost urgency, and everyone involved should prioritize it until it is resolved.

- `priority_major`: This label designates issues that are very urgent and should be addressed within a minimal timeframe, typically within 1-2 days but no more than 3 days.
    - If the developer anticipates challenges in meeting this timeframe, they are required to escalate the issue promptly.
- `priority_minor`: Issues labeled as such are given a lower priority and are typically positioned towards the end of the sprint cycle.

## Types Labels

- `type_bug`
- `type_feature`
- `type_question`
- `type_story`: This label is used to distinguish story cards, providing an overview of a use case the team aims to achieve.

### For monorepos

Repository owners are free to create labels per component in the monorepo for easier repo management
