## Agenda

- Min features + bugfixes <https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1370> (need the upcoming versions for each component)

### Focus

- Yggdrasil (the current call is fork?) issue will be closed and not be addressed
- Graceperiod fix is ready to be deployed on mainnet.
- Graphql update (moved to 3.8.1 still means it needs to be worked on parallel)
- QA not stopping to sync (issue resolved!)
- Monitoring phase1 is finished
- Third party service billing is now finished but needs to be deployed to devnet
- Release 3.8 to devnet (tuesday)
- Release 3.8 to qa-net (wednesday)

### 3.8.1 (should be worked on parallel)

- RMB rework is in progress
- Farmerbot is driven by KDS
- Docker compose deployment of the grid is going to be owned by Rob
- Ability for the farmers to stop/resume/delete workloads on their farmers
  - Is there a way actually for the farmer to identify a workload?
  - By public IP, which other criteria?
- Grid2 infrastructure decommission? (some farmers still didn't migrate, decommissioning will prevent the automigration)
- request for comments on the tendermintkv <https://github.com/threefoldtech/research/pull/12>
- Keep qsfs and zstor on qa focus
- Jimber closed source the browser again
- Operations chain/indexer snapshots
