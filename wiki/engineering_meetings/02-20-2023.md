## Agenda
- 3.8.0 is deployed on mainnet
- Test run status
- Manual status
- Substrate-client Repo status: Right now it’s only using commits, and issues not updated (project, milestone, status .. etc) 


3.9.0 (should be worked on parallel)
- Umbrel support 
- Remove the confusion between solution provider, sales channel, 3rd party billing 
RMB-relay / Solutions update to use the relay (terraform is done, typescript/dashboard, playground are in progress)
- Farmerbot 
- Documentation improvements we will only use mdbook for the grid i’ll prepare the workaround it and everyone is invited to improve it
- Docker compose deployment of the grid is blocked by ability to configure custom backend (weblets/dashboard): PR is present but there is more than dev, qa, test and main. We are working on setting up private grid stacks for development and testing. People should also be able to create grid instances for local internets.


### 3.10 
- Will be only GPU
- Ability for the farmers to stop/resume/delete workloads on their farmers 
Is there a way actually for the farmer to identify a workload?
By public IP, which other criteria?
