## Gaia-X hackathon

Geert said it’s not more than a single api that we send a post request for the farmer to an endpoint from the portal to mark the farmer as Gaia compatible?

## Wikis

Wikis aren't functional at the moment, issues been escalated, and tons of new information should be added

## More

- The development process isn't being respected, we keep breaking sprints and adding new features to things that are active for at least a month now. if sprint gets extended it's either for QA or not meeting the deadline for the features agreed on, not pushing on more features in.
