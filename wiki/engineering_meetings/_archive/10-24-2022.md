## Agenda

- Billing by 3rd party services ( lee) 3.8 (erwan?) ? who is syncing the project? https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/445#issuecomment-1280725022
- On chain minting https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1313 prio undefined, nobody is working on that 
- Power management with the removal of the same LAN restriction?
- Capacity planning status after the changes in the power management? (is there a penalty for asking a farm to reserve a capacity and waking up nodes or not?)
- ADRs are being created in ZOS and tfchain
- TPM is disabled due to failing tests
- What about TPM, for power management that is. (needs clarification)
- Shouldn’t we already put in a check that verifies the existence of tpm, so that new nodes without it can’t get registered ? (keeping in mind that oldies still should be allowed, e.g. set a node sequence number of today as last node ID to allow non-tpm nodes. _isn’t it the case already_ ? 
- MaxNodeContractPublicIPs been set to an upper limit and landed on mainnet
- JS-SDK upgraded to remove dependency on zos2/grid2 (Ghanem is doing more clean up)
- We are working on a chrome extension for the profile manager for the playground and the dashboard
- Minting October: Current minting code will no longer work with the new version (lee) (24th of october already) should be handled as soon as possible
- Bridges status polygon / eth (Amira/Rob)
- TFT on Polygon
- Fix Multisig on BSC/ethereum alike  bridges
- Polygon full node seems to be catching up -> Why Heimdall instead of only Bor? ->commented on the issue we need Bor, not Heimdall
- The deployment Ethereum full node doesn’t seem to have started yet -> not top prio, we’re doing Polygon first
