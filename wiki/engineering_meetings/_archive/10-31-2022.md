## Agenda

- Billing by 3rd party services status https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/445#issuecomment-1280725022 
- Power management with Capacity planning status (we need to allow manual override for farmers to force a node to be up)
- The extension work is already finished, we have a PR ready for the playground, will have it deployed for feedback, but not for 3.8
- Minting October: Current minting code will no longer work with the new version (lee) (31st of october already) should be handled as soon as possible (Do we have an issue)?
- Bridges status polygon / eth (Amira/Rob)
    - TFT on Polygon
    - Fix Multisig on BSC/ethereum alike  bridges
- Capacity certifier is still part of 3.8, but all still in accepted?
- Timeline for finishing, we were supposed to be code complete by now and the remaining two weeks would be for testing: The review, units and automated tests for tfchain and zos should have a clear idea by next week, also Brandon is going to need more help in migrations (Lee or Dylan can help)  
- Auto deploy projects with a workflow https://github.com/threefoldtech/tf_operations/issues/1220 , should be fine for all of the networks except for mainnet until Lee's concerns are discussed.
- Grid monitoring https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1294 (Lee/Jan)
