## Agenda

- Issues updates & repos sorting all looks great 
- KDS already objected to the Grid infra backend changes https://github.com/threefoldtech/tf_operations/issues/1220#issuecomment-1313447807  
- Billing by 3rd party services status https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/445#issuecomment-1280725022 End of week ready (power management needs to go live first)
- Power management with Capacity planning will be ready by wednesday max. 
- We continued the zos-chain update
- Grid monitoring https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1294  Jan started looking into it
- 3.7.2 been deployed on devnet, 3.7.2, qa, test and the testruns are already done. Mainnet should get started today
- Stellar services update to retire explorerv2: https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tft-stellar/issues/451
- Powermanagement should protect against booting nodes accidently in the farm as it will (this should be added in 3.9.x since it was not specced) 
- Mastodon weblet(s) got pushed as priority, will be available on a separate website
- Need 11 solutions provider ids for influencers who are going to host it 
- We still didnâ€™t manage to build a full VM for NixOS 
- Kristof, and other community members reported issues regarding stability of the network and failure to recover workloads after restarts
- They should also understand that devnet is subject to changes and most likely unstable to use 
- Nodes losing their dedicated status (this looks like a client issue imo)
- Dylan / bert/ brandon will go to subzero conf - polkadot - for two days (still not certain)
- Identity on chain (openid or DID?)
-
