## mycelium

An IPv6 overlay network completely writing in Rust, developed by Threefold. The overlay network uses some of the core principles of the Babel routing protocol (<https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/>). Each node that joins the overlay network will receive an overlay network IP in the 400::/7 range.
